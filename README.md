 Configurable 3d Transform Gizmo in Geometry Nodes

When working in Geomtetry Nodes, I find myself constantly rebuilding a little node group to generate arrows that I instance on points so I can visualize their orientation before replacing them with heavier geometry. I'm stuck on some other problem, so in the meantime I decided to build a proper tool. This one has a lot of configuration options and several examples of usage. Let me know if you find it useful, if there are any other features you'd like to see, or if you notice any bugs or other deficiencies. Enjoy!
